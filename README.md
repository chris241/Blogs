Project Name - ASP.NET Core Application
Overview
This project is an ASP.NET Core web application designed to [briefly describe what your project does, e.g., "manage blog posts", "handle room reservations", etc.]. It is built using .NET Core with a focus on scalability, performance, and ease of use.

Features
Feature 1: [Description of feature 1, e.g., "User registration and authentication"]
Feature 2: [Description of feature 2, e.g., "CRUD operations for blog posts"]
Feature 3: [Description of feature 3, e.g., "Integration with Google Calendar API for event booking"]
Feature 4: [Description of feature 4, e.g., "Admin dashboard with detailed analytics"]
Technologies Used
.NET 6 / .NET Core: The main framework for building the web application.
ASP.NET Core MVC: Used for building the Model-View-Controller structure.
Entity Framework Core: For interacting with the database using object-relational mapping (ORM).
SQL Server: As the main database for persistent data storage.
MediatR: To handle CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns.
Moq / xUnit: For unit testing and mocking services.
Swagger: For generating API documentation.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

.NET 6 SDK
SQL Server or any other supported database.
Node.js (if using front-end with SPA templates).
Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended for development).
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies
Restore the NuGet packages:

bash
Copier le code
dotnet restore
Install any front-end dependencies (if applicable):

bash
Copier le code
npm install
3. Configure Database
Open appsettings.json and update the connection string to point to your database:

json
Copier le code
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server;Database=your-database;User Id=your-username;Password=your-password;"
}
Run Entity Framework migrations to set up the database:

bash
Copier le code
dotnet ef database update
4. Running the Application
To run the application locally, use the following command:

bash
Copier le code
dotnet run
The application should now be running at https://localhost:5001/ (for HTTPS) or http://localhost:5000/ (for HTTP).

5. Running Tests
You can run the unit tests using the following command:

bash
Copier le code
dotnet test
API Documentation
This project uses Swagger for API documentation. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

bash
Copier le code
https://localhost:5001/swagger
This provides detailed information about all available API endpoints, request/response formats, and authorization requirements.
